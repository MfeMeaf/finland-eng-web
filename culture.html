            <br>
            <h3 class="CultureParagraphs">Background of the culture</h3>
            <p class="CultureParagraphs">Finnish culture is a mix between the native Finnish inhabitants and the Swedish culture. The reason being that Finland has been ruled over by Sweden for centuries. Because of this, the native Finnish culture started implementing aspects of Swedish culture. 
                This has also led to different ethnic groups in Finland, such as the Finns, Swedish-speaking Finns, and the Sami.</p>

            <br>
            <h3 class="CultureParagraphs">Family life</h3>
            <p class="CultureParagraphs">The Finnish family is often centered on the traditional nuclear family, rather than the extended family. Finnish families usually have one or two children. Traditionally, the men worked rather than the women.</p>
            <br>
            <h3 class="CultureParagraphs">Religion</h3>
            <p class="CultureParagraphs">Around 67% of Finns belong to the Lutheran Church of Finland, around 1.1% belong to the Greek Orthodox Church.</p>
            <br>
            <h3 class="CultureParagraphs">Entertainment and Games</h3>
            <p class="CultureParagraphs">Sketches are very popular in Finland. In Finland, video games are recognized as a form of culture. There are over 20 educational institutions that provide education in game development at all sorts of educational levels. </p>
            <br>
            <h3 class="CultureParagraphs">Finnish Cuisine</h3>
            <p class="CultureParagraphs">The traditional Finnish cuisine is a mix of European, Fennoscandian, and Western Russian elements. The food is usually simple, fresh, and healthy. The Finnish cuisine usually contains meat, berries, milk and ground vegetables; spices are rarely used in Finnish food, as it was historically unavailable.
